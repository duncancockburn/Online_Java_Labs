Answer the following questions


1) What is an instance variable?
variable relating to a class

2) How do you create a new object?
nameOfClass nameOfObject = new nameOfClass()

3) After creating a new object, how do you set that objects instance variables?

2 options for this:
By creating a constructor, who will have a list of arguments that will set up the values of the instance variables.
By adding setters (and getters) methods to the class for setting up the instance variables.

4) What is a reference variable? Why do you need to be careful with reference variables?

reference variables update the object in the memory.


5) How many methods can you have in a class?
as many as you want


6) How do you exit a method at any point?
break

7) What is the method signature required to return an "int" from a method?
arguments of type int?

8) Assuming "int num = 10", what is the syntax to return "num" from a method?
int num = 10;

static int method (int num)
return num

9) How do you pass a parameter to a method?
adding the parameters to the parenthesis in the method

10) What is the method signature for a method named sum() that takes two int parameters and returns their sum as in int?
a = 1
b = 2
public static int method2 (int a + int b)
return (a+b)

11) What is a constructor?
A constructor initializes an object when it is created
They are written similar to that of a method but they do not have a return type and are used to create initial values for an object when it is created
contructors tells the system which class the object relates to

so in the class- myContructor you need to put to contructor:
class MyFirstConstructor{
    int x;
    MyFirstConstructor(){
        x = 42;
    }
}


class Creator{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        MyFirstConstructor objectOne = new MyFirstConstructor(); // creates a new object of the class MyFirstConstructor
        System.out.println("The value of x for objectOne is: " + objectOne.x);
    }
}


12) How does Java treat a class without a constructor?


13) What would the constructor for "public class Animal" look like?


14) What is the effect of passing parameters to a constructor?


15) When should you pass parameters to a constructor?


16) What does the finalize() method do?


17) What does the "this" keyword do?


18) When should you use the "this" keyword?


19) Write an example of the "this" keyword in action.


20.) EXplain the difference between static and non-static variables.


21.) Explain the difference between static and non-static methods.
