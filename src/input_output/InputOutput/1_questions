Therefore a byte stream is different from a character stream. So, Java defines two types of streams: Byte Streams and
Character Streams . A byte stream access the file byte by byte. Java programs use byte streams to perform input and
output of 8-bit bytes


2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?


3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?


4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
allows to create one or more object as part of the try statement

dont need to define te variable outside te try block so now is available

i

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:



closes automatically so therefore finally statement is redundent



6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?


7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)


8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?


9) What is a BufferedReader?


10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?


11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument?


12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?


13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
