Demonstrate inheritance. Building on exercise_01, add private instance variables to the super class and use
the subclasses to set them.
Done


Building on the previous examples. Add constructors to each class. Also, if you haven't already, build out
the inheritance hierarchy at least three tiers.


For instance, Class_03 extends Class_02 and Class_02 extends Class_01.



Use private instance variables in each class. Use constructors in each class.


Be sure that Class_03 can set and modify variables in Class_01.




Further extrapolating on the previous exercises, add at least two methods to a superclass that are not
getter/setter methods. Demonstrate the use of these methods from a subclass.


As before, continue to build out the previous exercises. This time, demonstrate the use of overloaded
constructors in your superclass. Also, demonstrate the use of the "super" keyword. Also, demonstrate how to
override a method.

Demonstrate dynamic method dispatch. Refer to java_book_source Example19, but do not copy it verbatim.
